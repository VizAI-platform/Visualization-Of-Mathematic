# Using Python to Visualize Theoretical Mathematics

Utilizing Python, AI, and machine learning to create an interesting and intuitive method of understanding abstract mathematics.

---

## Overview

Because mathematics is abstract, it presents both teachers and students with a number of significant difficulties. Without appropriate visualization, it is challenging to give theoretical mathematics problems meaning. To overcome these obstacles, however, any practical mathematical metric—whether geometric or regular patterns—can be quite helpful.

This project presents a Python-based platform for visualizing difficulties in theoretical mathematics. This platform offers creative, research-based solutions for improved comprehension of abstract mathematical topics by combining AI and machine learning.
